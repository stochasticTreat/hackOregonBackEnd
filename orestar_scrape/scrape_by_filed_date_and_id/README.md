Notes on ORESTAR
--------------------
Orestar will give a maximum of 5000 lines at once (including the header, so 4999 records). Thus if more than 4999 records are returned in a search result, only the first 4999 records will be returned, ordered by date, descending. 
The R script running the scraper is built to check if each returned records set has exactly 4999 lines, and make additional requests to fill in missing records as needed.
